# zos_neural
TheDataCollector.ipynb and Datacollector.zmx is for generating data for single phasescreens. 
final.ipynb and Datacollector_final.zmx is for generating data for two phasescreens
Code 3 has the single phasescreen neural network 
Cn2_original is for refractive index structure constant neural network 
Turbulence has code for generating a kolmogorov phasescreen.
